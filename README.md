# Wheelie 🚗
A remote-controlled (RC) car based on the communication between two Arduino Uno3 boards. The car is capable of detecting obstructions along its path, using an infrared sensor, and has the ability to remove them, via a sweeping motion of an arm consisting of 2 servo motors.

## Award 🏆
*Wheelie* competed against 75 other submissions in an internal University competition, and after a live demonstration, was awarded **first place** in the “*Most likely to lead the robot uprising*” category. In addition to this title, the project was **awarded a prize in recognition of the quality of work**.
> The judges of this competition included Senior University Teaching Staff and Guest Lecturers.

## Demo 🎥
A live demonstration of *Wheelie*'s features can be seen in the following video:

## Report 📝
This project also included a separate report further explaining and evaluating the implementation. Specifically, the report covers:
- An introduction and description to the project
- A detailed Schema and final hardware layout
- In-depth explanations for the implementations of the:
  - Communication of two boards
  - Movement of the car
  - Torch and Horn controls
  - Sensor and Arm Control
> Please note that this project was developed before the usage of neutral terms for *Slave* and *Master* code segments, now known as *Leader* and *Follower*, became the norm.
